Description:  Original ctsem (continuous time structural equation modelling)
    functionality, based on the OpenMx software. These functions were split off from
    the main library of ctsem, as the main library uses the rstan package as a backend now --
    though offers estimation options from max likelihood to Bayesian.
    There are nevertheless use cases for the wide format SEM style approach as offered here, 
    particularly when there are no individual differences in observation timing and the
    number of individuals is large.
